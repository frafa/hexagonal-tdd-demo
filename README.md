# Exchange rate API

API to manage historical exchange rate. 


## Overview  
A simple experimental project use to:

- build an API following API first development approach;
- use API spec to generate a Open-API server in java using the SpringBoot framework; 
- hexagonal architecture;
- TDD.

### API First 
To build API spec was used [Apicurio studio](https://www.apicur.io/studio/) a good open source tool.
You can see the generated Open API file *exchange-rate-service.yaml*


### Generate Server
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)
You can generate OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework using *generate_src.sh*

### Hexagonal Architecture
Server create was implemented following the clean Hexagonal Architecture.

### TDD
Was followed the Test Driven Development approach.
